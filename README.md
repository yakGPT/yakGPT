Remember to use a supported web browser and ensure your microphone is functioning properly.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for building such amazing models and making them cheap as chips.
- [opus-media-recorder](https://github.com/kbumsik/opus-media-recorder) A real requirement for me was to be able to walk-and-talk. OpenAI's Whisper API is unable to accept the audio generated by Safari, and so I went back to wav recording which due to lack of compression makes things incredibly slow on mobile networks. `opus-media-recorder` saved my butt by allowing cross-platform compressed audio recording via web worker magic. 🤗
